You need a modified version of libowfat which supports
caltime/caldate functions. You also might want to
replace all calls to byte_{copy,zero,rcopy,equal,diff}
with their mem{cpy,cmp,set} aquivalents since they are
usually a lot faster and save space (several kilobytes).

I suggest you link against the vanilla dietlibc
