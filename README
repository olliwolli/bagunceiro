- A blog system

This is a blog system written in C designed to be a single small cgi script run
by a webserver. It was written using a (link)modified version of libowfat,
which, included cdb, the database I use to store the blog entries.

Questions and answers
Q: Why another blog system?
A: Because wordpress runs really slow on my vserver!

Q: Why do you use cdb, it does not seem to be a good choice for a blog system?
A: Because it is small and part of libowfat. The focus of this blog was not to
have a whole lot of features but to make it small and fast. I figured that on
a blog modifications and insertions are much less used as data querying.
For the purpose of showing small texts chronologically cdb is totally ok.
Using cdb it is possible to not overcomplicate the blog.
One feature that is awkward to implement though is searching through
the blog. Right now the implementation just goes through all the blog posts
doing a full-text search.

Q: Why did implement a command line client and not the MetaWeblog API (XML-RPC)
A: Why anyone would want to use a heavy client in order to post something
on the web nowadays escapes me completely. I can however understand if somebody
wants to write blog posts using a command line client over ssh.
 
Q: So how do you use cdb to store your blog?
A: I use on entry for every day which contains a list of references to
the actual blog entries.
