 - A blog system

This is a blog system written in C designed to be a single small cgi script run
by a webserver. It was written using a (link)modified version of libowfat,
which, included cdb, the database I use to store the blog entries.

Questions and answers
Q: Why another blog system?
A: Because everybody needs an "Extrawurscht"!

Q: Why do you use cdb, it does not seem to be a good choice for a blog system?
A: Because it is small an part of libowfat. The focus of this blog was not to
have a whole lot of features but to make it small and fast. I figured that on
a blog modifications and insertions are much less used as data querying.
For the purpose of showing small texts chronologically cdb is totally ok.
Using cdb it is possible to not overcomplicate the blog.
One features that is awkward to implement though is searching through
the blog. So thats missing right now, and yes I agree this hurts!

Q: So how do you use cdb to store your blog?
