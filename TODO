* indent breaks formatting arguments of print functions;
makes it kinda hard to read after writing

* the current implementation makes assumptions on the order of the keys in the
  database. It works for now.

* Implement index function that maps day->keys. So we can use only one file
  for the whole blog. For now we have the naive implementation where one file
  represents one day. The order of data in the day-database is the chronological
  order. So we can easily support following types of queries:
	- show me the last 7 days in chronological order
	- show me a range of days in chronological order
	- show me a certain day/month/year
	- show me a certain entry
  Note that this implementation needs to open a file for each day selected
  by the query.

  Following types of queries are not supported:
	- search the blog for a certain string
	- arbitrary sql like queries
